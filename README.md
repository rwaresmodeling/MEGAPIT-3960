o A descriptive title for your project (can be longer than your repository name)
o A short (~150-250 word) project overview that describes your research objective,
hypothesis, and your plan to test the hypothesis.
o A short (~150-250 word) description of the data you plan to use. What information does the
data contain? Where was it collected? Where did you get it?

Our project aims to test whether leaf litter composition affects the abundance of ground beetles in habitats along the Appalachian mountains. We predict that increased leaf litter biomass will be associated with increased ground beetle abundances in the sites. In order to test this hypothesis, we will use the "Litterfall and fine woody debris production and chemistry (DP1.10033.001)" and "Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps (DP1.10022.001)" data sets from NEON to get data on litter biomass and ground beetle abundance.
