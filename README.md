Climate change affects forest composition, oftentimes negatively. Varying forest structure will change leaf litter composition, which often serves as a food source and habitat for many organisms, such as arthropods. Ground beetles are a highly diverse group of insects that may act as a bioindicator of insect population health and ecosystem shifts. With the uptick of insect population abundance concerns, it is important to monitor beetle diversity and abundance change over time in hyperdiverse, understudied, and imperiled regions like Appalachia. Our project aims to address these concerns through testing whether leaf litter composition affects the abundance of ground beetles in habitats along the Appalachian mountains. We predict that increased leaf litter biomass will be associated with increased ground beetle abundances in the sites.

In order to test this hypothesis, we will use the "Litterfall and fine woody debris production and chemistry (DP1.10033.001)" and "Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps (DP1.10022.001)" data sets downloaded from NEON to get data on litter biomass and ground beetle abundance. The ground beetle dataset includes information relating to siteID, plotID, collectDate and taxonID. The litterfall datset includes information relating to siteID, plotID, collectDate, nitrogenPercent, carbonPercent and dryMass(in grams). Using these variables, we will able to match up sites/plots and collection dates between the datasets, and then compare the dry mass of the litterfall with the abundance of ground beetles (found using a count of taxon). While we are focusing on litter biomass as our predicting variable, we may also want to look at the percent carbon and the percent nitrogen in the leaf litter to see if that has any effect on the ground beetle abundance. We plan to use data collected from several sites near the appalachian mountains including GRSM, MLBS, ORNL, SCBI, BART, and HARV.
