Consequently, data are in a new format including, in many cases, different data fields. Details of the new processing pipeline can be found in http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/OS_generic_transitions_vA  and http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/Nicl_Language_DRAFT.  Additionally, manual QA of all existing beetle data was performed to rectify mismatches between field collected samples and downstream tables (sorting, pinning, and expert id)."

In 2018, reductions in sampling were necessary due to budget limitations (both the field sampling and analytical budgets).","Beginning in 2018, the sampling design was altered to eliminate one trap cup from each plot, resulting in reduced sampling per bout (3 traps per plot; 10 plots per site); this change resulted in a maximum of 30 samples generated per site per bout. The change in sampling effort reduced the number of samples generated during a bout; requiring a reduced budget for analytical costs to analyze samples (for species composition)."

In cases where fewer than the maximum number of records were generated per bout, this reflects lower levels of sampling effort and additional records should not be expected.","In 2020, NEON added the quality flag ""samplingImpractical"" to the `bet_trapping` table in this data product to assist users in understanding when data for this product are temporarily missing versus permanently unavailable. Beginning in 2020, there will *always* be one record generated per scheduled pitfall trap in the `bet_trapping` table."

Those early data are annotated in the `bet_sorting` table where the field sampleType has a value of 'common carabid' or 'other carabid'. Records with a sampleType of 'common carabid' were treated functionally the same as the current protocol. Where sampleType = 'other carabid', users must look in the `bet_parataxonomistID` table for fine-scale taxonomy. Records in the `bet_sorting` table using the 'other carabid' processing workflow were only annotated with 'Carabidae sp.' in the `bet_sorting` table and all finer scale information was entered into the `bet_parataxonomistID` table.","Many users found it confusing to have to collate taxonomic information from two tables, so NEON updated the procedure (NEON.DOC.014050; protocol version J and later) to consolidate all NEON staff taxonomic determinations into one table (`bet_sorting`). Taxonomy will continue to be provided in the `bet_parataxonomistID` table, but this table is primarily retained to communicate the identifiers of pinned beetles and allow users to perform table joining with determinations made by taxonomic experts (`bet_expertTaxonomistIDProcessed`)."

Data availability may be reduced during this time.,"The primary impact of the pandemic on observational data was reduced data collection. Training procedures and data quality reviews were maintained throughout the pandemic, although some previously in-person training was conducted virtually.  Scheduled measurements and sampling that were not carried out due to COVID-19 or any other causes are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical data field."

Using the collectDate in the eventID has created inconsistencies when making comparisons across samples of different trapping durations.",Starting in the 2022 data release the eventID will be based on the ISO week of the pitfall trap setDate. All eventIDs for existing data have been updated to reflect this change for the 2022 data release.

Obfuscating state-listed taxa has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity.",The state-level obfuscation routine was removed from the data publication process at all locations excluding sites located in D01 and D20. Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites.

This complicated NEON field scheduling logistics, which typically involves repeated travel across the state on short time frames. Consequently, NEON reduced staffing traveling to Toolik and was thus unable to complete all planned sampling efforts. Missed data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field.",The quarantine policy at Toolik Field Station ended after the 2022 field season.

Obfuscating state-listed taxa across an entire domain has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity.","To reduce the number of records in which taxonomic identifications are obfuscated in D01, the state-level obfuscation routine has been applied to data using site-level granularity as of 25 April 2023. Previously published data have been reprocessed using the more precise obfuscation routine for the 2024 data release and onward.
